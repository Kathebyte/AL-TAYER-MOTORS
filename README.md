# AL TAYER MOTORS

We have to keep a database (class) of customers where we can create a customer by getting the information from their (name, telephone, id, ...).

We also have to have a database (class) of cars available in the store (Make, Brand, mileage, color, price, type, warrantyTime ...)
Add a the database (class) of the employes who can sell the cars to customers (name, id)
Have also another class for the SALE of the car including (customerId, salesPersonId, carId, amount, date) where I can see to generate a receipt for the user
Have another class container salesperson commissions during the whole time sales (salesPersonId, salesArrayIds) where I can use to see how much a salesperson have earned

### Milestone 1:
Create the Class Diagram to have the visual solution before you start to code.
Create a menu in the console with all these requirements and make options to allow the user create every entity (Cars, Employees, Sale, Customers, etc) and I can sell a car and see commissions in the console output and also employees list, cars, and customers.
Beware of the SuperClasses expected: PERSONA, VEHICLE.

### Milestone 2:
Create a visual env so I can update and see this information in a more user friendly way

### Milestone 3:
Create JSON files with the information of all the entities so I do not have to fill the information again every time the program runs

### Milestone 4:
Create a MySQL database with Diagram Class where the previous info is store but also I can update it if I have the MANAGER role
